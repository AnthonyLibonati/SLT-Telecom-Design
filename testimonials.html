				</br>
				<p>My job schedule is really hectic and the only time I could be home for the install was after 8 pm.  Most of the other companies I spoke with could not accomodate me.  When I called SLT Telecom to set up my install time,<b><i> they were happy to come at my convenience</i></b>.  The installer was knowledgeable and professional and stayed with me until I fully understood my equipment.  I have already told my family and co-workers about SLT.</br></br>
